    <!--1. class : This means we give one class name to those tags which we want to do same CSS. let say we have 2 or 3 different tags whom we want to do same CSS.
    One way to do is doing their CSS seperately which will be time taking. other way is we can give same class na e to all of them and then later do CSS
    to that class this will save our time. In short we can say that class is a group which every tag has same CSS give same classname to them
    eg : h1 tag and p tag if they have same CSS, then give same classname to them and later do CSS to taht classname. 
    . classname is always given in opening tag. also we can give any classname. when css is done in seperate file. then use.classname{}

    .classname{
    here do all css
    }
    -->

    <h1 class="ismail">Hello this is ismail</h1>
    <p class="ismail">hello this is good</p>

    <!--2. id : is is used when we have same tag but we want tod o different CSS. Let say we have 4 h2 tags  and we want to do different CSS to all of them
     then in that case we can give seperate ID  to all of them.  we give id names in opening tag. 

     syntax to use id in css

     #idname{
     here do all css
     }
    -->

    <h2 id="id1">
  This is first 
    </h2>
    <h2 id="id2">
        This is second
    </h2>
    <h2 id="id3"">
This is third
</h2>
<h2 id="id4">
    This is fourth
</h2>
<!--3. group selector :  which ever tags has same CSS together we can do styling of taht tag-->
