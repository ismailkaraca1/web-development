Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting <br>
industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text<br>
ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of <br>
type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived<br>
<br>
not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,<br>
remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with <br>
the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and <br>
more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker <br>
including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

hover effect which means when we put mouse on something the color changes, also set the position using margin or position :absolute
